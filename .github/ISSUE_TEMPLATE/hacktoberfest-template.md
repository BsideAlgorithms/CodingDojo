All Hacktoberfest solutions should be provably correct. That is, solution submissions should either include the unit tests from the original challenge (implemented in your language of choice) or at least print out the expected answers when run by the maintainers. Solutions that do not meet these criteria may be rejected, or flagged as 'invalid' or 'spam' in egregious cases. Please be respectful of the maintainers' and other participants time by doing your best to submit real solutions to the puzzles. Thanks!
